I"><p>DeepMind’s algorithm AlphaGo amazed the whole world by beating 4-1 Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016. This complex algorithm learned to play Go by crunching thousands Go grandmasters plays. <code class="highlighter-rouge"> AlphaZero</code>, DeepMind’s latest breakthrough in the field is far more impressive. It easily outperformed AlphaGo by solely learning on its own. Now Deepmind secret algorithm recipe has beaten all state-of-the-art algorithm on most board games from chess to shoji. How was that made possible and what mathematical mechanisms lie underneath?</p>
