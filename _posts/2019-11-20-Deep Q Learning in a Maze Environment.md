Reinforcement learning techniques shows great potential for <a href="https://alehuger.github.io/board-game-ai"> game-based AI </a> but fails to scale on real-world applications. Indeed, state space and action space become continuous and, thus, prevent any tabular-based learning. 
Therefore, reinforcement learning agents require to be piloted by a learning decision function thus falling back on <code class="highlighter-rouge"> deep learning </code>.
